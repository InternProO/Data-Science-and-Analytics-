1.) Use the trained model to predict future trends

predicted = model.predict(X_train)

2.) To build a real-time data streaming pipeline, you can use Apache Kafka and Python for processing IoT data.

Step 1: Setting Up Kafka
Install and set up Kafka to handle streaming data.

Step 2: Producer (Simulating IoT Devices)
Simulate data generation from IoT devices.

Step 3: Consumer (Processing Data)
Consume the data and perform real-time analysis.

Step 4: Visualization
You can integrate real-time visualization using libraries like Plotly or Dash.
