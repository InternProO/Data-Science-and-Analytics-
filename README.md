The Following repository contains all the necessary examples which can be used by the candidates to get actual understanding of what exactly they have to implement in their tasks .

Basic Tasks:

1.) Data Visualization Tool:
Create a tool that automatically generates insights from user-uploaded datasets.
Present these insights in interactive graphs or visualizations.
Use tools like SQL, R, Python, and data visualization software.
Collaborate with organizational leaders to identify informational needs.
Present findings in an easy-to-understand way to inform data-driven decisions1.

2.)Predictive Model for User Behavior:
Develop a basic predictive model that forecasts user behavior.
Use historical data collected from a sample website.
Techniques may include regression, classification, or time series analysis.

3.)Social Media Sentiment Analysis:
Build a tool that scrapes social media data.
Generate sentiment analysis reports on trending topics.
Understand public sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) related to specific topics.

Intermediate Tasks:

1.)Custom Stock Market Prediction Model:
Design a machine learning model that classifies and predicts stock market trends.
Use multiple financial indicators (e.g., stock prices, trading volumes, economic data).
Handle structured and unstructured data.

2.)Web Application for Statistical Analysis:
Develop a web application where users can upload datasets.
Perform complex statistical analysis with visual feedback.
Provide features like hypothesis testing, regression, clustering, etc.

3.)Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline:
Create a pipeline that processes and analyzes live data from various sources (e.g., IoT devices).
Extract actionable insights in real time.
Consider scalability, data quality, and latency.

Advanced Tasks:

1.)Comprehensive Analytics Platform:
Integrate machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization.
Provide in-depth business intelligence.
Enable decision-makers to gain insights from diverse data sources.

2.)Data-Driven Simulation Tool:
Model various scenarios and outcomes for decision-making.
Apply to complex systems (e.g., supply chain management).
Use statistical simulations, optimization, and sensitivity analysis.

3.)Deep Learning for Economic Trends:
Create a deep learning model.
Identify and predict emerging trends in global economic indicators.
Analyze vast amounts of unstructured data (e.g., news articles, reports).
